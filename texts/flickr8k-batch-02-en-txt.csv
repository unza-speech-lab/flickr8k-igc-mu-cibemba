6	6_5250_2	1	When sliding she has relaxed the arms behind holding noth sides of the sides maybe it is  because  she is at the end.

10	10_2264_0	1	Six dogs are running in the ground they and they are even dressed 
10	10_2264_1	2	But why are they running? or where are they running to?

10	10_2264_3	2	How did do these dogs know that this is just a game?

10	10_2266_0	1	A young girl is seated in the water, besides the river 
10	10_2266_1	2	This girl looks as if she's seated besides the river not in the rivers 
10	10_2266_2	1	The reason I have said that is because the legs are hidden and she's even hiding her chest 
10	10_2266_3	2	This child is just folding her herself because what she's wearing is small 
10	10_2266_4	1	It's not a shirt she's wearing, it's something tbat loons like a bra
10	10_2267_0	1	On a certain place, in the evening, there are a lot of people, and dollies are even hanged on the the metal bars in and outside

10	10_2267_3	2	Not every body seems to buy in the shop

10	10_2268_0	1	A man is climbing the mountain and he's holding a rope
10	10_2268_1	2	What can cause him to climb the mountain? 
10	10_2268_2	1	It seems to be a game or maybe he's just working because he is even pulling a container 
10	10_2268_3	2	If this is working, then it's not a good work
10	10_2268_4	1	With him it can be a good job because people choose to do the work they want 
10	10_2269_0	1	Two people are in the water playing with a ball and between then there is a net. 
10	10_2269_1	2	What game are they playing? 
10	10_2269_2	1	This game is what is called volleyball ball, in English 
10	10_2269_3	2	And they are playing in the water without drawning
10	10_2269_4	1	People play this game on water they know how to swim 
10	10_2270_0	1	On this picture there are a lot of people walking 
10	10_2270_1	2	Some are standing waiting to cross the road 
10	10_2270_2	1	How do you know they want to cross the road? 
10	10_2270_3	2	The reason I said that is because I can see a black car in front of them

10	10_2272_1	2	This man is without a shirt, maybe he was swimming. 
10	10_2272_2	1	The place where they are seems to be very hot

10	10_2273_1	2	These two children are are fighting because one has kicked the other on the belly 
10	10_2273_2	1	They are not fighting maybe they are just playing because most of the times it's how kids play 
10	10_2273_3	2	The reason I said so is because one has kicked the other so strongly with his mouth wide open 
10	10_2273_4	1	No, they must be siblings, they are just playing 
10	10_2274_0	1	Two dogs are playing and one is carrying a ball 
10	10_2274_1	2	Even dogs can play like this? 
10	10_2274_2	1	All animals, there is a unique way they play 
10	10_2274_3	2	I didn't know dogs can play like this with a ball. 
10	10_2274_4	1	depending with how they were raised, they can play like this.

10	10_2276_3	2	Maybe it's following its owners the ve left it behind 
10	10_2276_4	1	It's just playing because there is no one

10	10_6003_0	1	A group of people are standing on the street and they have covered themselves with umbrellas 
10	10_6003_1	2	These people look like they're together 
10	10_6003_2	1	I believe the they look and the dress code is what is causing that
10	10_6003_3	2	They look like they are not moving, they are just facing each other and talking to each other 
10	10_6003_4	1	These people, it's like there is something that they are waiting for and all of them it's just the same thing

10	10_6006_3	2	Bit what has caused it to ppen its mouth when walking

10	10_6007_0	1	The do has jumped high, it's holding a plate 
10	10_6007_1	2	So is that plate a stolen one  or what? 
10	10_6007_2	1	That plate is just thrown to it by someone 
10	10_6007_3	2	But why are they not just giving it food instead of playing with it? 
10	10_6007_4	1	This is just a game of playing with animals, it doesn't mean they won't give it

10	10_6013_3	2	He seems to be rushing for something very nice

13	13_3010_3	2	Or maybe loves to see people.
13	13_3010_4	1	Behind the boat, there seems to be buildings and a forest.
13	13_3011_0	1	A kid has jumped from the top of the table to down where there is a blanket.
13	13_3011_1	2	He's not putting on anything on his upper body, he's only wearing a trouser.
13	13_3011_2	1	He sseems to be very happy, the way he has opened up his hands. Maybe someone is trying to catch him.
13	13_3011_3	2	It appears, though he should hurt himself while being caught.
13	13_3011_4	1	The child seems to be used to this.
13	13_3012_0	1	Two men are competing in riding bicycles.
13	13_3012_1	2	There is a also a group of people watching them. They want to see who will be victorious at the end.
13	13_3012_2	1	Behind, there is a kid who is with the parent, looks like he is being taught how to ride. 
13	13_3012_3	2	Maybe when he learns how to ride a bicycle he would want to participate in competing with the others.
13	13_3012_4	1	Yeah maybe, there is even a red Coca cola banner. 
13	13_3013_0	1	A dog is running on the grass, it's running towards the person who took this picture.
13	13_3013_1	2	Looks like the one whose taking this picture is the owner. Because it doesn't look like it wants to bite someone.

13	13_3014_3	2	Yes it seems so. There's also a very small house, wondering what it's used for.
13	13_3014_4	1	It looks like a toilet.
13	13_3015_0	1	The dog has jumped high, trying to drink water coming out of the hose pipe.
13	13_3015_1	2	Perhaps, the water coming out of the hose pipe is being used to train the dog on how to jump very high. 
13	13_3015_2	1	It could be, maybe that's how he plays with his dogs, by spraying water up in the air.

13	13_3016_2	1	One girl isn't putting on school uniforms like the rest, but regular clothes.
13	13_3016_3	2	Maybe they all came to visit the girl in clothes because she missed class on that day.

13	13_3017_2	1	There are those in the crowds that are putting on a jersey similar to this man. It seems they are fans for the team he's playing for and they came to cheer them up.

13	13_3018_2	1	It seems he is so lost in thoughts.

13	13_3020_2	1	Looks like it really has them confused in figuring what it is. Or they are trying to figure the things written on it.
13	13_3020_3	2	Looks like they have never seen it before. They want to figure out what it is.

18	18_8011_3	2	Children are a gift from God, that why they must be done for everything needed.
18	18_8011_4	1	These children also, can somehow be so silly, that phone may not even be connected anywhere but to them it is everything in the world.
18	18_8012_0	1	A brownish dog is on grass playing.
18	18_8012_1	2	This species of dogs seems to be much in contact with man playing.
18	18_8012_2	1	Yea it is just that, even the facial expressions appear to anxious for a catch.
18	18_8012_3	2	And the dog is around the kids' playpark.
18	18_8012_4	1	And it so true, it is most likely the owner who took it out for play.
18	18_8013_0	1	A young man is running in the children's play grounds.
18	18_8013_1	2	But could he be racing for fun or something?
18	18_8013_2	1	He must be doing it for self status, because one must be able to guage self needs.
18	18_8013_3	2	Myself thought what has is doing was done by the aged .
18	18_8013_4	1	Oh boy, it is so important to be self mastery as running is ageless.
18	18_8014_0	1	Three girl children are in underpants playing outside.
18	18_8014_1	2	The one on the right must have made her friends laugh, because the middle one has laughed so much.
18	18_8014_2	1	You just know in childhood, but the one on the left side is not smiling as if unaware of anything.
18	18_8014_3	2	My dear it is said that the community always has that idle one, she is just rigid to realize how funny that is.
18	18_8014_4	1	And the joking one must be too jovial that the friend is so excited that she is even held her tummy.
18	18_8015_0	1	A vehicle is moving, it has passed over muddy water.
18	18_8015_1	2	This very place is bushy, with so much trees along the road.
18	18_8015_2	1	Yea dear, one would tell just by the bad road that is why driving in the sides.
18	18_8015_3	2	I pity the car owner, by the time they arrive the car would be so dirty.
18	18_8015_4	1	Do not even punic, they must have known before using this route and moreover it will go for car wash.
18	18_8016_0	1	Two men in the middle of the crowd, one is on the top jumping over the friend's head wrestling.
18	18_8016_1	2	Is this fight a reality show or something faked to entertain the crowd?
18	18_8016_2	1	Well, this game is quite unpredictable because who could one really jump off to hit another for fun.
18	18_8016_3	2	Exactly what I meant, because jumping on one's head is totally fatal, we who are weakly better not.
18	18_8016_4	1	These are trained professionals dear, and I guess they are forgiving one to another.
18	18_8017_0	1	A gentleman is on his motorbike spinning with a crowd of people around watching.
18	18_8017_1	2	Everyone is excited and happy to see how he is drifting his machine.
18	18_8017_2	1	My dear this event is such a big thing, many people come by to watch and enjoy how that one can do what exceptionally.
18	18_8017_3	2	However the crowd when you are hurt you are on your own with relatives only.
18	18_8017_4	1	Dear for one to participate in anything there must be a reason, this sport is well sponsored and the winner is awarded unreservedly.
18	18_8018_0	1	A gentleman is on his bigger motorbike riding among hills and his dog following behind.
18	18_8018_1	2	This place looks like a bush, there are so many thickets and you would even become anthophibic.
18	18_8018_2	1	Not so my dear, these people are used using such routes so they know what is or what is not around.
18	18_8018_3	2	I am sure those are steel bars I see behind him, he could be an electrician.
18	18_8018_4	1	Not really my dear, instead he must a farmer headed to his field but this was the convenient route to take.
18	18_8019_0	1	A man and gent, father and son, are driving a mini car on grass.
18	18_8019_1	2	My dear it seems the man is teaching his son driving.
18	18_8019_2	1	Yea dear, he is instructing him how to drive so that he can be his own driver.
18	18_8019_3	2	Modern kids are knowing things earlier, while we played draft and hide-&-seek.
18	18_8019_4	1	Yea dear things have changed, can't you just see how the chap is excited, he is so happy though fearful.
18	18_8020_0	1	A young boy is playing with soapy water making bubbles.
18	18_8020_1	2	Are these bubbles supposed to be let break on their own or you prick?
18	18_8020_2	1	On the other side of the picture some fingers are busy pricing them.
18	18_8020_3	2	And this game though, my dear did you have chance to play it?
18	18_8020_4	1	Hmm this was everywhere you go game, but we chanced anybody washing for soapy water then play.
18	18_8021_0	1	A gentleman is in the mountain top, and there are ricks in the sides.
18	18_8021_1	2	It seems it took him time to get up there, but now exhausted.
18	18_8021_2	1	Mountain climbing is quite tiresome, very exciting as he views the world as a god
18	18_8021_3	2	The clouds are closer to mountains, and up there you feel closest to God.
18	18_8021_4	1	You have cracked my ribs, it is exciting when you get there, forgetting your climbing struggles.
18	18_8022_0	1	A crowd of people is gathered together, amidst are two kids with one in red cap and another in head cover.
18	18_8022_1	2	These people are just too much, can you even guess what is happening?
18	18_8022_2	1	Dear friend, such moments of big crowds could be for soccer or boxing events elsewhere.
18	18_8022_3	2	But have you considered how the boy in red cap is looking at the other, as if he is the one going to fight.
18	18_8022_4	1	Hmm not that dear, that look is just to show attentiveness as his friend seems to be telling him something.
18	18_8023_0	1	A gentleman is sliding on snow up the house.
18	18_8023_1	2	This house must have been destroyed by snow after much of it fell on it.
18	18_8023_2	1	Yea dear, as snow can become heavy with time.
18	18_8023_3	2	Dear this place must be such a very cold one, as he is dressed up so warmly.
18	18_8023_4	1	Very much cold, if by any chance he slipped and fell it would hurt as you know wounds with cold.
18	18_8024_0	1	Two gents are competing in soccer, beside them a crowd is around to cheer up.
18	18_8024_1	2	And there are cameras, while others just watch could this game be this interesting?
18	18_8024_2	1	Definitely my dear, this sport is really exciting though appearing to be a fight.
18	18_8024_3	2	Some games just need you to eat more than, so that when you get in it is till sundown.
18	18_8024_4	1	Hmm you are just glutton, there is nothing hard after training, they seem hard but not when you are focused.
18	18_8025_0	1	A child is playing in a room, jumping off the smaller bed on to a bigger one.
18	18_8025_1	2	My dear but won't this kid hurt himself while doing so, because the heights are so big.
18	18_8025_2	1	Just as you know about kids, fir him that is hight.
18	18_8025_3	2	I now see how much an elderly person must monitor kids, else you find them hurt.
18	18_8025_4	1	Exactly, just as you can see he is not even concerned as long as he is doing what he desires.
18	18_8026_0	1	A crowd of people, with a gentleman's bike wheeled up. 
18	18_8026_1	2	And what could have led him do such in the crowd of people?
18	18_8026_2	1	The whole place is crowded, thus he had to press through the crowd.
18	18_8026_3	2	This gent though, why not find another route if this way is impassable?
18	18_8026_4	1	You are been funny, what if this is the shortest to wherever he was going?
18	18_8027_0	1	A child is cried out loudly for the food on the display.
18	18_8027_1	2	There must be delicious foods for a child to be this restless about it.
18	18_8027_2	1	Children are just mysterious, right there you cannot tell what they mean.
18	18_8027_3	2	Very much true dear, buying for them what they won't even eat.
18	18_8027_4	1	Now that you know, just carry enough cash when going with your children else you will regret.
18	18_8028_0	1	Three people, one man and two ladies, are walking having smiled so much.
18	18_8028_1	2	For sure the have smiled but my friend could one lady be a spouse to the man?
18	18_8028_2	1	Well my thought was that this is a couple with their daughter on the far end left side.
18	18_8028_3	2	What you say is relatively a true reflection of the lady on the left being youngest.
18	18_8028_4	1	Yea dear they must have been on an outing, as you know people are stretching out oftentimes.
18	18_8029_0	1	Two dark and big dogs are playing in grass.
18	18_8029_1	2	Dear have you seen how they look fierce, if found you at night just pray before you are eaten raw.
18	18_8029_2	1	You are such a joker, see how they are excited but for cynophobics this is a passing out moment.
18	18_8029_3	2	And this is so bushy where the dogs are, could they have been taken out here for training by the owner?
18	18_8029_4	1	You may not really know, much as you hate dogs.
18	18_8030_0	1	A white dog is in water with a stick in the mouth.
18	18_8030_1	2	Dear little did I know dogs can also swim, I thought once they drop in water that is their end.
18	18_8030_2	1	Dear dogs are trainable animals, there are others to whom dogs are like babies you cannot even tell.
18	18_8030_3	2	Oh yea, then this dog issue is gone to another level but what could the stick in the mouth for?
18	18_8030_4	1	They may have thrown it in the water and then asked to get it out, but as you know it has nothing else but the mouth to hold and carry.
18	18_8031_0	1	A crowd of people is on the road, and a parent is lifted up their child.
18	18_8031_1	2	The child's face though as if crying.
18	18_8031_2	1	Just as you know that children cry when among strangers.
18	18_8031_3	2	And the running crowd of people seems to have come from one place.
18	18_8031_4	1	It seems they planned for this, at times people want to shake off their bodies.
18	18_8032_0	1	A gentleman is swimming in a plastic pool on the gray.
18	18_8032_1	2	And I can see a big sea behind him, it seems he is just learning how to swim.
18	18_8032_2	1	Yes dear, he does not know how well to do it in deep water hence the alternative.
18	18_8032_3	2	Very true if you cannot swim, just his facial expressions as if he is seen something weird.
18	18_8032_4	1	Exactly my dear, you need to be an amateur at least because at the same time you do not need to be hydrophobic.
18	18_8033_0	1	Two ladies have smiled, one is even held on her friend's shoulder.
18	18_8033_1	2	This place they stand by, has got a nice tree behind them.
18	18_8033_2	1	Yea dear, this tree is mostly in homes and available around the time of christmas.
18	18_8033_3	2	Oh I see the reason for their smiles, it is the period of the birth of Jesus, so they are excited.
18	18_8033_4	1	And they seem to be born of the same family.
18	18_8034_0	1	A lady is on a train with a small book reading.
18	18_8034_1	2	The lady looks humble, I guess that is why she is even seated alone.
18	18_8034_2	1	Hmm who said that to sit alone is humbleness, may be the train was not packed.
18	18_8034_3	2	Even though it was halfway one must not be a loner, 'two are better than one' goes a Bemba say. 
18	18_8034_4	1	She may have wanted to read her book that is why she sat alone.
18	18_8035_0	1	A dog and cow are in the field, the dog has ran but the cow standing still.
18	18_8035_1	2	And this place is bigger, there could be a fence to keep animals inside.
18	18_8035_2	1	But looking at how the dog has ran, could it be it wants to chase after a cow?
18	18_8035_3	2	It must be afraid of the cow, because a dog is not something that can chase it.
18	18_8035_4	1	Or it may have seen something else and that is why running, otherwise dogs are for chasing after things.
18	18_8036_0	1	A black dog is on grass, it is bitten a small ball by the mouth.
18	18_8036_1	2	Its eyes upwards looking as if it is seen something.
18	18_8036_2	1	Yea dear, I guess it is looking at the owner of the ball.
18	18_8036_3	2	It is frightened by the fact that it has already broken the ball.
18	18_8036_4	1	The way dogs like playing especially when having something to bite.
18	18_8037_0	1	A dog is on a hill top trying to eat a grass rising upwards.
18	18_8037_1	2	This dog is just by so much grass, I wonder why just that one grass?
18	18_8037_2	1	Dogs are specific, it is not every type of grass they can eat but may be just that one.
18	18_8037_3	2	It has widened its mouth, even the visible teeth so sharp.
18	18_8037_4	1	It must have been quite hungry, like the Bemba say 'when a lion lacks even grass becomes meat'.
18	18_8038_0	1	A man is in his spectacles grimaced.
18	18_8038_1	2	And this man is most likely to be around the crowd, his glasses reflects people.
18	18_8038_2	1	Yea dear, even his smile shows that he is talking to s lady as in his glasses.
18	18_8038_3	2	And this man had smiled, it seems the lady excited him so much with her outfit.
18	18_8038_4	1	Another man is looking at his doings with a mean eye afar, you may just see a sudden fight here.
18	18_8039_0	1	Two kids are playing, one is tied a paper on the leg and the other one is with a coat at the back.
18	18_8039_1	2	The older kid seems to want say something, but the younger is busy in his games.
18	18_8039_2	1	Kids are unpredictable, so them doing all the tying of legs may mean nursing their oozing wounds.
18	18_8039_3	2	Meanwhile his younger is not concerned about it, he is on his own with a coat.
18	18_8039_4	1	Childhood is a tricky milestone, they may have had different interests in their play so at last each one for himself God for us all.
18	18_8040_0	1	A group of old people, ladies and gentlemen, then one gent is in front.
18	18_8040_1	2	They are most likely to be having some TV presentation, as the gent is setting up the projector.
18	18_8040_2	1	And they seem to be divided into groups, here and there.
18	18_8040_3	2	Their gathering appears to be that of Church, because they are so mixed together.
18	18_8040_4	1	You are right dear this could be Church, as there are all sorts of people at Church.
18	18_8041_0	1	A lady and two gentleman are in the pair of shoes.
18	18_8041_1	2	But my dear why are they in the same pair of shoes as if twins?
18	18_8041_2	1	They seem to be siblings, see how the young boy is looking at his elders.
18	18_8041_3	2	I have noticed dear, the way he just looks at them so mean, this is scary as if one would fly onto you.
18	18_8041_4	1	Hmm do not be scared, he may be listening to something from them, and to hear it he has to concentrate.
18	18_8042_0	1	A kid is playing with the aim of jumping off the rock 
18	18_8042_1	2	The place it is by has shaded off leaves and dry.
18	18_8042_2	1	The kid is likely to hurt itself as it tries to jump off.
18	18_8042_3	2	Kids are are just like this dear, till they do it their own way, if not then they are unstoppable.
18	18_8042_4	1	Like a say goes 'children are restless till done', just leave them fulfil their immediate gratification. 
18	18_8043_0	1	People are by the children's playpark, one boy is sliding on a water slide while the others wait.
18	18_8043_1	2	This water can scare you, the way they are splashing the water can't it choke sight?
18	18_8043_2	1	Not really my dear, as these kids know how to play with each other even as you can see that one closing his eyes when getting in water.
18	18_8043_3	2	Those of his friends waiting are too anxious that they go next after him.
18	18_8043_4	1	Being a child is something else, in their minds they are at peace till they do it their way.
18	18_8044_0	1	A gentleman is by the riverside, beside the river are many trees around.
18	18_8044_1	2	And the sky is so bright with a clear cloud, that it may not be expected to rain.
18	18_8044_2	1	My dear could this gentleman be a fisherman?
18	18_8044_3	2	I doubt but he may be only using a boat to cut across.
18	18_8044_4	1	Well I thought he could be a fisherman as the river looks to have much fish.
18	18_8045_0	1	A gentleman is by the water with his dress off, and dipped his hair behind in water with much splash.
18	18_8045_1	2	The sun is brightly shining on the water, even his hair shines nicely.
18	18_8045_2	1	This gent has realized what you are saying, as he has smiled at the scene.
18	18_8045_3	2	Yea dear friend, there has never been anything beautiful to look at except God's creation.
18	18_8045_4	1	And this place is surrounded by so many trees.
18	18_8046_0	1	A dog is on snow, it seems to have a red dog belt.
18	18_8046_1	2	The dog appears to be quite cold such that it is failing to walk.
18	18_8046_2	1	Yea dear, as snow can really be so cold.
18	18_8046_3	2	This dog though, looks so dull as one starved of food.
18	18_8046_4	1	It is not anything like that dear, this dog is just cold and it takes time to warm up.
18	18_8047_0	1	A male parent is carrying an older child while a female parent is with a younger one before a priest.
18	18_8047_1	2	It appears this priest is blessing the younger one instead, as it looks like a newly born.
18	18_8047_2	1	Yea dear friend, even just the priest's smile is towards the newly born in the mother's hands.
18	18_8047_3	2	Could it be that they are baptising  them or something, because the parents are quite excited.
18	18_8047_4	1	I doubt if so, because baptism is water based but the priest only has a Bible.
18	18_8048_0	1	A man is in black with a cigarette, he is passing by the building surroundings.
18	18_8048_1	2	Behind his backward direction there is a vehicle.
18	18_8048_2	1	Yea dear it seems this place is flocked to by many vehicles.
18	18_8048_3	2	But this man though, you wonder why walking with so many vehicles around.
18	18_8048_4	1	Hmm relax my dear, he may have reached or going to board a car.
18	18_8049_0	1	A lady and gentleman are together playing while parents are watching closely.
18	18_8049_1	2	But why are the parents taking a closer look at them?
18	18_8049_2	1	Who knows except themselves, may be because the gent is smoking.
18	18_8049_3	2	Or could it be that which he is whispering to a lady they want to get clearly?
18	18_8049_4	1	Yea dear even as the way the lady has just smiled, you may not doubt.
18	18_8050_0	1	A gentleman is on the water playing, and a crowd is round about watching.
18	18_8050_1	2	And while on water he is holding onto something, what could that be?
18	18_8050_2	1	It could be a boat as it is the one that moves on water.
18	18_8050_3	2	And people are just excited to watch him turning around.
18	18_8050_4	1	Exactly dear, these are the things that excite many people.
18	18_8051_0	1	A gentleman is riding on a donkey in the ground.
18	18_8051_1	2	There is a crowd of people around the playgrounds watching on him riding.
18	18_8051_2	1	He is not even afraid of falling off the donkey.
18	18_8051_3	2	These are well trained and so they are fearless.
18	18_8051_4	1	It seems he is been doing this game for a while and so he is a professional.
18	18_8052_0	1	A person is with his dog playing beside the sea.
18	18_8052_1	2	There is a hilly landscape beside the gent and he seems like throwing an object in water.
18	18_8052_2	1	The dog is looking at him with an eager eye for a catch.
18	18_8052_3	2	Could it be that the dog will then dive in to pick it up after his throw?
18	18_8052_4	1	It seems so as this gent is playing with his dog, even as it also enjoys.
18	18_8053_0	1	A child is playing happily.
18	18_8053_1	2	Trees and flowers beside the smiled child have shaded off many leaves.
18	18_8053_2	1	This child is most likely to be with other people joking with it.
18	18_8053_3	2	Obviously because someone cannot be smiling this much without cause.
18	18_8053_4	1	The child and those playing with it seem to be happy people.
18	18_8054_0	1	Five people are on the mountain top playing.
18	18_8054_1	2	This top mountain seems to be so cold as they are in winter clothes.
18	18_8054_2	1	How about this turned lady who could she be shouting to, others around?
18	18_8054_3	2	Ladies my dear are unpredictable, she could just be funny with her tongue out.
18	18_8054_4	1	It seems like they are here for the first time and so the excitement.
18	18_8055_0	1	A gentleman is running towards a fire brigade vehicle with his dog.
18	18_8055_1	2	The firefighters appear to be at work, but the gent is also head on straight.
18	18_8055_2	1	There is also a woman beside the vehicle, seemingly to go elsewhere.
18	18_8055_3	2	Indeed there are different road users, but could it have a break down or not?
18	18_8055_4	1	They seem to be out on a fire mission, but indeed the road is for all road users.
18	18_8056_0	1	An old man is laying down on grass leaning while reading a little book.
18	18_8056_1	2	Someone cannot move to such a place just to read a little, do people need their peace this much?
18	18_8056_2	1	Peace, just like love, is scarce to many so this man must be enjoying such an outskirt.
18	18_8056_3	2	Man is unpredictable, he may have gone out just for a breather when earthly anxieties perplexed him.
18	18_8056_4	1	It is very important to be freed up to some stress as an individual.
18	18_8057_0	1	Three dogs are playing on grass, one on the floor and two standing up.
18	18_8057_1	2	They are playing in a surrounding like environment with trees.
18	18_8057_2	1	It is just that way and they seem like big time friends.

18	18_8090_1	2	Most people are seated except for him, they seem to have been away but now back.
18	18_8090_2	1	They all have looked and watching how the man is passing the baby on to the other one.
18	18_8090_3	2	These people though, why look at him so anxiously as if he is doing otherwise?
18	18_8090_4	1	I tell you, this is weird but we may not really tell whether or not they are just leaving.
18	18_8091_0	1	Four people are sitting by the riverside gazing at the setting sun. 
18	18_8091_1	2	They are all seated smartly, I have admired their view of God's masterpieces.
18	18_8091_2	1	That is true dear, I am hopeful they too are reflecting and wondering the direction of the sun.
18	18_8091_3	2	And these people though, are they not concerned about the approaching darkness?
18	18_8091_4	1	They are not afraid of darkness as they are many, and may have just gone out for a walk and catch up.
