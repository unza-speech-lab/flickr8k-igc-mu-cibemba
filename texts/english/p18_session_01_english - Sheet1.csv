8002,A boy is in the ground playing.,"Dear, what sort of a game is this boy playing?","My friend, did you not engage in such sports?","Not that I had not, except modern kids are different.","Oh yea, this game is called backflipping or acrobatics."
8003,"Two kids, boy and girl, are playing on a steel plate.","Dear, the girl is upset and seated alone, could it be that the boy provoked her?","Highly possible to be truth, because boys are such bullies.","Nay dear, it is not about bullying these are most likely to be in love.","Hmm love is not for under age, they must have misunderstood each other's game interests."
8004,"Two dogs are on the road, one tied up with a rope and the other one moving freely.","Dear, but what could the loose dog be doing behind the other?","Huh you are funny, it is most likely to be eating insects from its fellow's feathers.","Oh boy, I was thinking otherwise it would bite the other dog.","Oh yea, but not so as dogs have a tendency to pick off each other's insects."
8005,A man is sitting just by the store entrance.,But dear what could make him sit by the door in this manner?,It could be that he is either tired or drunk.,"For sure it is either ways, or is he a street beggar taking a rest?","Who knows my dear, the world is no more friendlier and such could be so."
8006,"A young boy is holding up his hands, and there people around him.",So what could the boy be looking at with his mouth widely opened this way?,The place he is in appears to be a playpark.,"He must have seen some wonder, surprised to this extent?","Oh yea, these places tend to have so much attraction."
8007,Two dogs are headed to a thicket.,"Dear these are dogs seem to be fierce, just their race is hunty, as if after some fatty food.","These dogs must be playing only, as they love running around.","No way my dear friend, they are likely to be fierce as they have bigger mouths, just run away.","The problem is that you are full of cynophobia, dogs are friendly to humans and enjoy man's company."
8008,A black dog is playing with a ball on dry grass.,"I am quite surprised at how a dog can do such, all my life I thought dogs are human chasers.",My dear there are people who have trained their dogs good manners to do anything else.,"And the dry grass is too much, could they have taken it in the thicket?","Not really but that some people have got bigger surroundings, and have put up enough grass."
8009,"A gentleman is carrying a lady on his back, and another woman holding hands with a man coming behind them.","These people seem to be in much love, the way they are walking even the place they are in seems for such.","They must have had so much cares of the world, so they sort to be away from anything else.","Which cares for the world are you referring to, do not be too conscious they may have just been out on a chill.","There is so much care in this world though, some are stuck during the week at place of work, and others too busy mostly so this is what they choose for relief toward each other."
8010,A dog has sprinted through the waters.,"Could these waters the dog is traversing, be rainfalls or something else? ",These waters appear to be rainfall as they are full and not stagnant.,"This dog also seems to be fierce, with an opened mouth as if hungry.","Dear this dog is just vulnerable, as it must have been out for long and the rains caught up while out there."
8011,A kid is on a phone call with a wide smile.,And the caller must have said something interesting to the kid.,"Just the smile is enough, I like it and desire for one also.","Children are a gift from God, that why they must be done for everything needed.","These children also, can somehow be so silly, that phone may not even be connected anywhere but to them it is everything in the world."
8012,A brownish dog is on grass playing.,This species of dogs seems to be much in contact with man playing.,"Yea it is just that, even the facial expressions appear to anxious for a catch.",And the dog is around the kids' playpark.,"And it so true, it is most likely the owner who took it out for play."
8013,A young man is running in the children's play grounds.,But could he be racing for fun or something?,"He must be doing it for self status, because one must be able to guage self needs.",Myself thought what has is doing was done by the aged .,"Oh boy, it is so important to be self mastery as running is ageless."
8014,Three girl children are in underpants playing outside.,"The one on the right must have made her friends laugh, because the middle one has laughed so much.","You just know in childhood, but the one on the left side is not smiling as if unaware of anything.","My dear it is said that the community always has that idle one, she is just rigid to realize how funny that is.",And the joking one must be too jovial that the friend is so excited that she is even held her tummy.
8015,"A vehicle is moving, it has passed over muddy water.","This very place is bushy, with so much trees along the road.","Yea dear, one would tell just by the bad road that is why driving in the sides.","I pity the car owner, by the time they arrive the car would be so dirty.","Do not even punic, they must have known before using this route and moreover it will go for car wash."
8016,"Two men in the middle of the crowd, one is on the top jumping over the friend's head wrestling.",Is this fight a reality show or something faked to entertain the crowd?,"Well, this game is quite unpredictable because who could one really jump off to hit another for fun.","Exactly what I meant, because jumping on one's head is totally fatal, we who are weakly better not.","These are trained professionals dear, and I guess they are forgiving one to another."
8017,A gentleman is on his motorbike spinning with a crowd of people around watching.,Everyone is excited and happy to see how he is drifting his machine.,"My dear this event is such a big thing, many people come by to watch and enjoy how that one can do what exceptionally.",However the crowd when you are hurt you are on your own with relatives only.,"Dear for one to participate in anything there must be a reason, this sport is well sponsored and the winner is awarded unreservedly."
8018,A gentleman is on his bigger motorbike riding among hills and his dog following behind.,"This place looks like a bush, there are so many thickets and you would even become anthophibic.","Not so my dear, these people are used using such routes so they know what is or what is not around.","I am sure those are steel bars I see behind him, he could be an electrician.","Not really my dear, instead he must a farmer headed to his field but this was the convenient route to take."
8019,"A man and gent, father and son, are driving a mini car on grass.",My dear it seems the man is teaching his son driving.,"Yea dear, he is instructing him how to drive so that he can be his own driver.","Modern kids are knowing things earlier, while we played draft and hide-&-seek.","Yea dear things have changed, can't you just see how the chap is excited, he is so happy though fearful."
8020,A young boy is playing with soapy water making bubbles.,Are these bubbles supposed to be let break on their own or you prick?,On the other side of the picture some fingers are busy pricing them.,"And this game though, my dear did you have chance to play it?","Hmm this was everywhere you go game, but we chanced anybody washing for soapy water then play."
8021,"A gentleman is in the mountain top, and there are ricks in the sides.","It seems it took him time to get up there, but now exhausted.","Mountain climbing is quite tiresome, very exciting as he views the world as a god","The clouds are closer to mountains, and up there you feel closest to God.","You have cracked my ribs, it is exciting when you get there, forgetting your climbing struggles."
8022,"A crowd of people is gathered together, amidst are two kids with one in red cap and another in head cover.","These people are just too much, can you even guess what is happening?","Dear friend, such moments of big crowds could be for soccer or boxing events elsewhere.","But have you considered how the boy in red cap is looking at the other, as if he is the one going to fight.","Hmm not that dear, that look is just to show attentiveness as his friend seems to be telling him something."
8023,A gentleman is sliding on snow up the house.,This house must have been destroyed by snow after much of it fell on it.,"Yea dear, as snow can become heavy with time.","Dear this place must be such a very cold one, as he is dressed up so warmly.","Very much cold, if by any chance he slipped and fell it would hurt as you know wounds with cold."
8024,"Two gents are competing in soccer, beside them a crowd is around to cheer up.","And there are cameras, while others just watch could this game be this interesting?","Definitely my dear, this sport is really exciting though appearing to be a fight.","Some games just need you to eat more than, so that when you get in it is till sundown.","Hmm you are just glutton, there is nothing hard after training, they seem hard but not when you are focused."
8025,"A child is playing in a room, jumping off the smaller bed on to a bigger one.","My dear but won't this kid hurt himself while doing so, because the heights are so big.","Just as you know about kids, fir him that is hight.","I now see how much an elderly person must monitor kids, else you find them hurt.","Exactly, just as you can see he is not even concerned as long as he is doing what he desires."
8026,"A crowd of people, with a gentleman's bike wheeled up. ",And what could have led him do such in the crowd of people?,"The whole place is crowded, thus he had to press through the crowd.","This gent though, why not find another route if this way is impassable?","You are been funny, what if this is the shortest to wherever he was going?"
8027,A child is cried out loudly for the food on the display.,There must be delicious foods for a child to be this restless about it.,"Children are just mysterious, right there you cannot tell what they mean.","Very much true dear, buying for them what they won't even eat.","Now that you know, just carry enough cash when going with your children else you will regret."
8028,"Three people, one man and two ladies, are walking having smiled so much.",For sure the have smiled but my friend could one lady be a spouse to the man?,Well my thought was that this is a couple with their daughter on the far end left side.,What you say is relatively a true reflection of the lady on the left being youngest.,"Yea dear they must have been on an outing, as you know people are stretching out oftentimes."
8029,Two dark and big dogs are playing in grass.,"Dear have you seen how they look fierce, if found you at night just pray before you are eaten raw.","You are such a joker, see how they are excited but for cynophobics this is a passing out moment.","And this is so bushy where the dogs are, could they have been taken out here for training by the owner?","You may not really know, much as you hate dogs."
8030,A white dog is in water with a stick in the mouth.,"Dear little did I know dogs can also swim, I thought once they drop in water that is their end.","Dear dogs are trainable animals, there are others to whom dogs are like babies you cannot even tell.","Oh yea, then this dog issue is gone to another level but what could the stick in the mouth for?","They may have thrown it in the water and then asked to get it out, but as you know it has nothing else but the mouth to hold and carry."
8031,"A crowd of people is on the road, and a parent is lifted up their child.",The child's face though as if crying.,Just as you know that children cry when among strangers.,And the running crowd of people seems to have come from one place.,"It seems they planned for this, at times people want to shake off their bodies."
8032,A gentleman is swimming in a plastic pool on the gray.,"And I can see a big sea behind him, it seems he is just learning how to swim.","Yes dear, he does not know how well to do it in deep water hence the alternative.","Very true if you cannot swim, just his facial expressions as if he is seen something weird.","Exactly my dear, you need to be an amateur at least because at the same time you do not need to be hydrophobic."
8033,"Two ladies have smiled, one is even held on her friend's shoulder.","This place they stand by, has got a nice tree behind them.","Yea dear, this tree is mostly in homes and available around the time of christmas.","Oh I see the reason for their smiles, it is the period of the birth of Jesus, so they are excited.",And they seem to be born of the same family.
8034,A lady is on a train with a small book reading.,"The lady looks humble, I guess that is why she is even seated alone.","Hmm who said that to sit alone is humbleness, may be the train was not packed.","Even though it was halfway one must not be a loner, 'two are better than one' goes a Bemba say. ",She may have wanted to read her book that is why she sat alone.
8035,"A dog and cow are in the field, the dog has ran but the cow standing still.","And this place is bigger, there could be a fence to keep animals inside.","But looking at how the dog has ran, could it be it wants to chase after a cow?","It must be afraid of the cow, because a dog is not something that can chase it.","Or it may have seen something else and that is why running, otherwise dogs are for chasing after things."
8036,"A black dog is on grass, it is bitten a small ball by the mouth.",Its eyes upwards looking as if it is seen something.,"Yea dear, I guess it is looking at the owner of the ball.",It is frightened by the fact that it has already broken the ball.,The way dogs like playing especially when having something to bite.
8037,A dog is on a hill top trying to eat a grass rising upwards.,"This dog is just by so much grass, I wonder why just that one grass?","Dogs are specific, it is not every type of grass they can eat but may be just that one.","It has widened its mouth, even the visible teeth so sharp.","It must have been quite hungry, like the Bemba say 'when a lion lacks even grass becomes meat'."
8038,A man is in his spectacles grimaced.,"And this man is most likely to be around the crowd, his glasses reflects people.","Yea dear, even his smile shows that he is talking to s lady as in his glasses.","And this man had smiled, it seems the lady excited him so much with her outfit.","Another man is looking at his doings with a mean eye afar, you may just see a sudden fight here."
8039,"Two kids are playing, one is tied a paper on the leg and the other one is with a coat at the back.","The older kid seems to want say something, but the younger is busy in his games.","Kids are unpredictable, so them doing all the tying of legs may mean nursing their oozing wounds.","Meanwhile his younger is not concerned about it, he is on his own with a coat.","Childhood is a tricky milestone, they may have had different interests in their play so at last each one for himself God for us all."
8040,"A group of old people, ladies and gentlemen, then one gent is in front.","They are most likely to be having some TV presentation, as the gent is setting up the projector.","And they seem to be divided into groups, here and there.","Their gathering appears to be that of Church, because they are so mixed together.","You are right dear this could be Church, as there are all sorts of people at Church."

"
8043,"People are by the children's playpark, one boy is sliding on a water slide while the others wait.","This water can scare you, the way they are splashing the water can't it choke sight?","Not really my dear, as these kids know how to play with each other even as you can see that one closing his eyes when getting in water.",Those of his friends waiting are too anxious that they go next after him.,"Being a child is something else, in their minds they are at peace till they do it their way."
8044,"A gentleman is by the riverside, beside the river are many trees around.","And the sky is so bright with a clear cloud, that it may not be expected to rain.",My dear could this gentleman be a fisherman?,I doubt but he may be only using a boat to cut across.,Well I thought he could be a fisherman as the river looks to have much fish.

8047,A male parent is carrying an older child while a female parent is with a younger one before a priest.,"It appears this priest is blessing the younger one instead, as it looks like a newly born.","Yea dear friend, even just the priest's smile is towards the newly born in the mother's hands.","Could it be that they are baptising  them or something, because the parents are quite excited.","I doubt if so, because baptism is water based but the priest only has a Bible."
8048,"A man is in black with a cigarette, he is passing by the building surroundings.",Behind his backward direction there is a vehicle.,Yea dear it seems this place is flocked to by many vehicles.,"But this man though, you wonder why walking with so many vehicles around.","Hmm relax my dear, he may have reached or going to board a car."
8049,A lady and gentleman are together playing while parents are watching closely.,But why are the parents taking a closer look at them?,"Who knows except themselves, may be because the gent is smoking.",Or could it be that which he is whispering to a lady they want to get clearly?,"Yea dear even as the way the lady has just smiled, you may not doubt."
8050,"A gentleman is on the water playing, and a crowd is round about watching.","And while on water he is holding onto something, what could that be?",It could be a boat as it is the one that moves on water.,And people are just excited to watch him turning around.,"Exactly dear, these are the things that excite many people."

8056,An old man is laying down on grass leaning while reading a little book.,"Someone cannot move to such a place just to read a little, do people need their peace this much?","Peace, just like love, is scarce to many so this man must be enjoying such an outskirt.","Man is unpredictable, he may have gone out just for a breather when earthly anxieties perplexed him.",It is very important to be freed up to some stress as an individual.
